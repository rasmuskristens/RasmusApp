the idea for my project is an app where the customers can order a drink in night clubs. I have been working with a friend of mine to establish it and thought it could be cool if we where to a prototype that could be used in real life.
The customer can sit in a bar, login with their username and password and from there create an order that can be sent to the bartender making the drinks. When the drinks are done, a runner could bring them down to the table for extra tip, or the customers could fetch them themselves. 
The app should have different activities that shows the drinks as well as an approximation of how long time it might take for the drinks to be made and served.
