# RasmusApp

The app is a project I am trying to make with a friend from Copenhagen who came up with the idea. I thought it looked fun and wanted to work something out. The goal is to create an app that allows customers at a night club to create an order instead of having to wait in line. The idea is, that sometimes you can feel overlooked and not get your order placed, when a trandtional line can be hard to form in tiny nightclubs. The idea is to have an app where you can order your drinks and have the bartender make it. When the drinks are done you could either have someone come down with it for a tip(where it is more for show to others with fireworks and so on) or pick it up yourself.



MoSCoW:

Must have: There must be a user password feature that allows the customer to place an order

You can pick and choose the items you want from a item list there should be images of the items along the price a main activity, with different subacitivties

should have: It should be able to see how long time it takes for your drinks to be ready a map with different clubs that shows the average time before customers receive there drinks ratings for each club/you coudl rate the places

could: payment addons that can be stored in a database customization of drinks (avoiding misunderstandings whilst talking with loud music in the background) suggestion boxes with ideas about what drinks to buy friend feature where you can see what club they are at, by where they ordered last(like snapchat where you can turn on and off the GPS signal for privacy)
